Izilla jQuery Touch Menu Hover
==============================

### Allows ULs that open on li:hover to open on tap/click on mobile platforms such as Android, WP7 etc.

Safari on iOS is the only major mobile browser that opens child ULs when tapped; every other platform just follows the link. With this plugin, the click/tap event is intercepted allowing the menu to be opened. Tapping the link again will follow it. Tapping anywhere else on the document will close the menu.

$('parent-ul-selector').touchMenuHover();

eg. $('#nav').touchMenuHover();
